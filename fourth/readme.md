## Problem Statement
Write a program to store a list of contact names and telephone numbers, similar to the contact lists you might find on a mobile phone. The data needs to be stored in a file so that it is persistent â€“ that is, the data available at the beginning of a new execution of the program is the same as at the end of the previous execution.
